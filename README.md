# reup

The goal of reup is to provide sane ways to install a new `R` library based on
old one.

It is inspired from [this](https://gist.github.com/rmflight/f3d6d1982e707350606e)
simple `R` script that was intended for purely personal use.

## Installation

You can install reup from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmflight/reup")
```
